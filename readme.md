# What's in here?

Some code prototyping the replication web-application functionality via aggregation of data from personal APIs.  

/twitter is an example aggregator that replicates Twitter functionality
twitter.js is also a twitter clone, but is completely decentralized, and relies on users to maintain the service themselves

# Some hints on how to develop

All the stuff here relies on running a personal API that serves JSON data.
